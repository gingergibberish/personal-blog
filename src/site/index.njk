              Hi.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my little spot on the web. Another incarnation, after a long hiatus, of my personal website.
          </p>
          <p>
            It exists to serve as a home for anything I want to write about, any code I want to share or any projects that I have worked on recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has very little content, as of November 2020, as it has only just reappeared onto the web and well, there's a global pandemic going on.
