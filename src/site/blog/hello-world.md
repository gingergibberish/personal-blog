The website returns!

After a long, long hiatus I've put up a new version of my website that I'm actually happy with. One that I should be able to keep working on and expanding.

<!--more-->

My real aim is to create a hub for projects, both serious and silly, that I work on and any bits of writing that I come up with.

It has always been a struggle to find things to write, share or add simply becaue I want everything to be _perfect_ before I put it out there. That won't be the case this time, 
things will be shared sooner and more often and then any tweaks can be part of a work in progress.

I'll stick some analytics on the site, I doubt it'll get much traffic anyway.

The post date for this particular blog post is a little white lie. The site didn't return until the 17th July 2020 but I thought my birthday would be a good date to have as the _"first"_ post.
